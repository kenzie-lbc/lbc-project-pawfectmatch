```PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many shelters struggle with outdated methods of advertising available pets for adoption, 
which reduces the visibility of pets in desperate need of homes and can lead to overcrowding. 
There is a need for an accessible user-friendly app that can consistently take applications for 
available pets and save them from euthanasia by streamlining the adoption process, while also 
allowing shelters to efficiently manage and showcase the pets that are still in need of love and a home.

```USER STORIES

# As an adoption agency, I want to remove a pet if they already found a loving home.
